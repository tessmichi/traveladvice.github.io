This is meant to be a brief primer on travelling to Japan.  To make it easy, details for major cities ([Tokyo][tokyo], [Kyoto][kyoto], [Osaka][osaka], the island of [Hokkaido][hokkaido]) have been broken out into separate pages.  This page will contain general Japan information such as what to pack, what airports are in the area, common phrases, etc.


## Packing for Japan

The biggest concern when packing for Japan is arguably clothing.  Many people think of Japan and think of business and that they need to wear formal business clothing to both work and out to eat.  Unless you’re going to Japan with plans to meet customers / partners at their place of work or doing a major presentation, chances are good you do not need to bring dress clothes.  Additionally, chances are good that if you’re going to a restaurant / occasion strict enough to warrant something more than business casual, you already know you'll need nicer clothes.  If you're traveling for work, you should check in with your colleagues who work there to gauge what attire would be appropriate. I’ve never worn anything more than business casual and even that has been uncommon on my trips.  Comfortable walking shoes are highly recommended as you'll inevitably do a lot of walking.  Additionally, bring good socks.  Many places will require you to remove your shoes and you don't want to be inappropriate.  To figure out what kind of weather to prepare for, and therefore what kind of clothes to pack, review the [Weather in Japan](#weather-in-japan) section.

Obviously, bring the sort of stuff you’d take on any other trip to a major city with beautiful scenery, like your camera.  For power adapters, you’ll often find outlets that match the American 3 prong style.  More common though is the two prong style also used in the United States.  For those, they make two prong to three prong adapters if needed.  

## Getting to Japan

You’ll most likely be flying into either Haneda or Narita airports.  Haneda airport is much closer to Tokyo itself and, therefore, is easier to get to.  Most airlines still fly into Narita airport from the US which is further away and I’ll provide more information about below.  As I fly Delta, they fly to Narita from Seattle so the bulk of my knowledge is based off that.  In early 2020, Delta will be moving to Haneda and out of Narita so this guide will be updated after that.  There are also major airports in Osaka and Sapporo.

## Travelling between Cities in Japan and the Shinkansens

Flying between distant cities such as Tokyo to Sapporo or Osaka is quite possible, however, many people choose to use the [Shinkansen][Shinkansen] or Bullet Trains.  This is a high speed rail system that goes through much of Japan.  The Shinkansen can take you from and to the major visitor destinations of Japan including [Tokyo][Tokyo], [Kyoto][Kyoto], [Osaka][Osaka], Hiroshima, and many more smaller towns.  Additionally, you can use a combination of Shinkansen and ferry to get from the main area of Japan (Honshu) to Sapporo on the island of Hokkaido.  For cheaper Shinkansen tickets, look at getting a [JR Pass](#jr-pass).

## IC Cards

On the topic of paying for trains, you’ll want to go a few minutes early to your first station, or spend the time at the airport picking up a Pasmo or Suica card.  To buy one, once you get to the station, find the machines that specify they sell [Pasmo](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/) / [Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html) cards.  You’ll then follow some simple instructions, don’t worry they have an English button.  Additionally, you can review [this very handy guide](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/buy/) explaining how to buy a card.  I believe you can [buy a Suica card online](https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/services/suica-card) though I don’t have experience with it.  Note, you’ll **NEED** yen.  It’s possible for residents to pay with their credit cards and mobile phones but you’ll need yen in order to pay for your travel card and top it up (using the same machines).  Once you have a card, you can go through the agentless gates where you’ll tap the machine on your way through and then tap when you exit the next station.  One thing to note is that it is possible to get into a place where you can’t exit because the exit is associated with a line that isn’t supported by your Pasmo / Suica.  If this happens, just look for the booth near the ticket gates that has an agent in it and ask for help.  You may need to pay in yen so make sure you have some on you.  Additionally, there are some trains and stations that don't support IC cards such as the Hakodate liner going west beyond Otaru in Hokkaido.  In general, there will be signs posted and announcements made if this happens.  As always, if you run into trouble, find the staffed booth near the ticket gates to get help.  Note that Kyoto appears to have their own IC card called the [Icoca](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-prepaid-cards-icoca-pasmo-and-suica).  All of these cards *should* work everywhere regardless of what card you get.  Your ability to return the card for your deposit at the end of your trip may depend on you doing so in the city it was purchased though.

## JR Pass

The [Japan Rail Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Rail_Pass) (JR Pass) is a railpass for overseas visitors which enables you to use most Shinkansens as well as all JR line trains and the Narita Express.  Effectively this means that for the cost of the JR Pass, you can ride on all of those trains for free.  The JR Pass is quite expensive at about $271 USD for 7 days.  The pass is also available in 14 day and 21 day formats.  Additionally, you can purchase an Ordinary or a Green pass with the Green being equivalent to first class.  Important to note is that for the Shinkansens and Narita Express, you still need to go to a JR office to make a reservation.  It's a good idea to plan out your trains early and go make the reservations you need to.  Also important, there are some Shinkansens that you can't use on the JR pass (notablly the Nozomi and Mizuho lines).  A useful app for finding routes within the limitations of the JR Pass is [Japan Travel by Navitime](https://www.navitime.co.jp/pcstorage/html/japan_travel/english/).  A useful website is [HyperDia](http://www.hyperdia.com/).

For normal JR lines, you don't need a reservation but you will need to walk by a booth with an attendant to show them your valid pass since you won't be swiping in with a Pasmo / Suica card.  You'll find the usefulness of this pass within the cities to be somewhat different.  Tokyo has many JR lines so you can get around quite well with just the JR Pass.  Kyoto and Osaka don't have as many lines so it's use will be more limited.  Most, if not all, cities have other lines like subways that are not covered by the pass.  Also, when you are exiting a station that has multiple exits, it's possible the fastest exit for you to get where you're going does not have a staffed booth.  You'll need to go to a different exit that does have the booth in this situation.  

There are many sites that you can order a JR Pass from and you must order it prior to visiting Japan.  I have used [IACE](https://www.iace-usa.com/en/jrpass/ticketssale) many times in the past.  There is no way to purchase once in Japan.  Plan for enough time for the pass voucher to be sent to you before leaving.  Once you arrive in Japan, you should be able to redeem the voucher for your pass at a JR office in any major airport or train station.

## Weather in Japan

Japan is a very *tall* country stretching from tropical islands of Okinawa in the south to [humid continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate) [Hokkaido](hokkaido) in the north.  That means  that you could be encountering a very wide variety of weather depending on where you're going and what time of year you're going.  

## Restaurant Reservations

When it comes to dining, reservations are generally highly recommended.  There are thousands upon thousands of restaurants in every major city and plenty of restaurants in the smaller places.  Your chances of getting into a place will be much higher if you've secured a reservation ahead of time.  Anything resembling a Michelin star restaurant will require one.  To get a reservation, your best bet is to go through your hotel concierge.  Note that they will likely require a credit card to hold a reservation regardless of if the restaurant takes credit cards or not.  **VERY IMPORTANTLY** when it comes to reservations, do your utmost to not need late changes or cancellations.  You may be used to things being more fluid where you're from but in Japan, cancellations or late changes are looked down upon.  

## Convenience Stores (Konbini)

Convenience Stores, or konbini, are everywhere in Japan.  The three big chains are 7-11, Family Mart, and Lawsons.  On top of being a reliable place to use your ATM card, these places are great for a snack and a drink.  The food isn't what you're used to if you're familiar with American convenience stores though and is actually very good and frequently eaten by normal Japanese people.  I'll frequently get a couple of [onigiri (rice balls)](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/guide-to-convenience-store-onigiri/) or a sando along with a cold green tea for breakfast and come in under $5 USD.  The stores will always take credit cards.  If you're buying alcohol, be prepared to press a button on the screen to indicate you are old enough to buy alcohol.


![Ekiben Shop](/assets/images/japan/ekiben.jpg){: .align-right  style="width:400px"}

## Ekiben (Train Bentos)

While included in the food list below, ekiben deserve their own section.  In any train station that serves as a stop for a [Shinkansen][Shinkansen] or other long distance trains such as the Super Hokuto (which goes between Hakodate and Sapporo) you'll find an Ekiben shop.  Ekiben's are bento boxes made specifically for the long train rides and they come in all varieties.  The most simple ones are Katsu Sando's but you'll see ones with sushi, with Japanese curry, and so many more you might spend more time picking out your Ekiben than you will eating it.  This is the one place you're likely to see people eating on the trains.  Also, the same Ekiben shops will also sell drinks including water, green tea, beer, and canned highballs.  Some trivia to tell your friends, ekiben is a combination of the Japanese word for station, "eki", and **ben**to.

## Random Tips

* Don’t try to ask for alterations to food dishes (i.e. don’t try ordering a chirashi bowl with salad instead of rice)
* Whenever handing somebody something (i.e. a credit card for purchases) it’s customary to use two hands and put it in the provided “dish” in front of them and not to hand it directly to the person.
* Much like visiting other countries, don’t bring vegetables or meat with you.  Also, if you are bringing prescription medication (ESPECIALLY Painkillers), bring documentation of the prescription being for you (i.e. the bottle with the prescription and your name on it)
* There are not a lot of garbage cans around the cities of Japan.  Expect to walk around with anything you have to throw away for a while or until you find a Starbucks.  Or better yet, don’t walk around with anything you might end up needing to throw away.
* No tipping.  It’s considered offensive.
* Whenever you enter a restaurant’s private room, you’ll likely want / need to remove your shoes.  Expect whoever is taking you in to indicate this and be ready to do it.  Custom is for shoes to point towards the door.
* The toilets in Japan have a lot of technology included.  You should be able to understand what most of the buttons are for thanks to the diagrams.
* Some restaurants will have a small box with a button on the table.  This is used to flag the waitstaff and should be used instead of waving your hands.  If there isn't one, don't be afraid to say excuse me to someone.
* Many restaurants will keep an updated copy of the bill at your table.  This may be so you can take the bill up to a central register when done though it's not always this way.
* If you want the bill, you can also hold your index fingers up in an X.
* While smoking inside is somewhat common, smoking outside is not.  If you’re a smoker, make sure you’re in a spot it’s allowed outside.
* It is possible you’ll walk into a restaurant and ask for a table and be met with a not-friendly look along with crossing of fingers/forearms.  They, generally, aren’t trying to be rude.  They’re afraid of not being able to give you good service because you don’t speak Japanese and they don't speak English.  Try to take it in stride and find somewhere else to eat or go with a Japanese fluent friend or colleague.  
* Museums and temples and parks and shrines are generally free.  The protocol for donating at a shrine is easy to learn and only costs a coin.  
* Your ATM card will likely not work at most normal banks or ATMs.  Instead, use ATMs at the airport or at convenience stores like 7-11, Family mart, Lawsons, etc.  If you’re staying at the Strings in Shinagawa there is a 7-11 right outside the door.  You'll also see 7-11 branded ATMs in some train stations you may be able to use.
* You may hear about [Maid Cafes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_caf%C3%A9).  These are an odd (at least for non-Japanese) phenomenon called a cosplay cafe.  In them, waitresses dress as maids and serve you food and drink and take pictures and do performances.  You’ll find these throughout Tokyo though most likely in Akihabara.
* Animal Cafes are another thing in Tokyo.  This is where you go and sit amongst animals of a certain type and I’ve heard of quite a variety include owl cafes, snake cafes, penguin cafes, and more.  If you're interested I’d highly suggest reading reviews and trying to get a feel for how well a place takes care of the animals.  Generally, reviews indicate things aren't very humane.
* Vending machines are everywhere in Japan and are a quick way to get a coffee, water, green tea, etc.  You'll also find ones that dispense miso soup, beer, highballs, and more exotic fare.
* Canned cold coffee is much more prevalent in Japan.  
* The [Shinkansen][Shinkansen] are the famous bullet trains of Japan.  Unfortunately, if you’re just visiting Tokyo, you won’t be taking one of these.  If you’re staying in the Shinagawa area, you’ll almost certainly see them pulling in / leaving from the station.  
* Walking with food and drink is fairly rare.
* A reminder: you should get some yen before you leave or shortly after arriving.  Your ATM card won’t work at all ATMs but getting a Pasmo / Suica card and filling it requires yen.
* If you’re going shopping, bring your passport with you.  Many stores will sell you things untaxed since you’re taking it back to the states but they need to staple the receipt to a page in your passport.  There will be someone you hand that in to when you leave at the airport.  You'll see red signs that say "Japan. Tax-free Shop".  Note that some shops will require you to go to a centralized tax refund center to get your refund vs doing it in the store for you.
* There is a minimum purchase amount to meet the tax-free rebate and it's currently at 5000 yen.
* At Japanese sushi restaurants, miso soup is usually enjoyed at the end of the meal, unlike in American places where it’s at the beginning.
* Formally exchanging business cards in Japan is [a thing](https://blog.gaijinpot.com/exchanging-business-cards-japan/).
