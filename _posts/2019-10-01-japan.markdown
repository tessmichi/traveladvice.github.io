This is meant to be a brief primer on travelling to Japan.  To make it easy, details for major cities ([Tokyo][tokyo], [Kyoto][kyoto], [Osaka][osaka]) have been broken out into separate pages.  This page will contain general Japan information such as what to pack, what airports are in the area, common phrases, etc.


## Packing for Japan

The biggest concern when packing for Japan is arguably clothing.  Many people think of Japan and think of business and that they need to wear formal business clothing to both work and out to eat.  Unless you’re going to Japan with plans to meet customers / partners at their place of work or doing a major presentation, chances are good you do not need to bring dress clothes.  Additionally, chances are good that if you’re going to a restaurant / occasion strict enough to warrant something more than business casual, you already know you'll need nicer clothes.  If you’re going to the Microsoft office, you will absolutely see many people in dress clothes.  This is especially true when you see the rush hour throngs spilling out of Shinagawa Station.  I’ve never worn anything more than business casual and even that has been uncommon on my trips.  I do highly recommend good, comfortable walking shoes.  There is a lot of walking to be done in Japan.  Speaking of which, bring good socks.  Many places will require you to remove your shoes and you don't be inappropriate.

Obviously, bring the sort of stuff you’d take on any other trip to a major city with beautiful scenery, like your camera.  For power adapters, you’ll often find outlets that match the American 3 prong style.  More common though is the two prong style also used in the United States.  For those, they make two prong to three prong adapters if needed.  


## Getting to Japan

You’ll most likely be flying into either Haneda or Narita airports.  Haneda airport is much closer to Tokyo itself and, therefore, is easier to get to.  Most airlines still fly into Narita airport from the US which is further away and I’ll provide more information about below.  As I fly Delta, they fly to Narita from Seattle so the bulk of my knowledge is based off that.  In early 2020, Delta will be moving to Haneda and out of Narita so this guide will be updated after that.  There are also major airports in Osaka and Sapporo.

## Travelling between Cities in Japan and the Shinkansens

Flying between distant cities such as Tokyo to Sapporo or Osaka is quite possible, however, many people choose to use the [Shinkansen][Shinkansen] or Bullet Trains.  This is a high speed rail system that goes through much of Japan.  The Shinkansen can take you from and to the major visitor destinations of Japan including [Tokyo][Tokyo], [Kyoto][Kyoto], [Osaka][Osaka], Hiroshima, and many more smaller towns.  Additionally, you can use a combination of Shinkansen and ferry to get from the main area of Japan (Honshu) to Sapporo on the island of Hokkaido.  For cheaper Shinkansen tickets, look at getting a [JR Pass](#jr-pass)

## JR Pass

The [Japan Rail Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Rail_Pass) (JR Pass) is a railpass for overseas visitors which enables you to use most Shinkansens as well as all JR line trains and the Narita Express.  Effectively this means that for the cost of the JR Pass, you can ride on all of those trains for free.  The JR Pass is quite expensive at about $271 USD for 7 days.  The pass is also available in 14 day and 21 day formats.  Additionally, you can purchase an Ordinary or a Green pass with the Green being equivalent to first class.  Important to note is that for the Shinkansens and Narita Express, you still need to go to a JR office to make a reservation.  It's a good idea to plan out your trains early and go make the reservations you need to.  Also important, there are some Shinkansens that you can't use on the JR pass (notablly the Nozomi and Mizuho lines).  A useful app for finding routes within the limitations of the JR Pass is [Japan Travel by Navitime](https://www.navitime.co.jp/pcstorage/html/japan_travel/english/).  A useful website is [HyperDia](http://www.hyperdia.com/).

For normal JR lines, you don't need a reservation but you will need to walk by a booth with an attendant to show them your valid pass since you won't be swiping in with a Pasmo / Suica card.  You'll find the usefulness of this pass within the cities to be somewhat different.  Tokyo has many JR lines so you can get around quite well with just the JR Pass.  Kyoto and Osaka don't have as many lines so it's use will be more limited.  Most, if not all, cities have other lines like subways that are not covered by the pass.

There are many sites that you can order a JR Pass from and you must order it prior to visiting Japan.  I have used [IACE](https://www.iace-usa.com/en/jrpass/ticketssale) many times in the past.  There is no way to purchase once in Japan.  Plan for enough time for the pass voucher to be sent to you before leaving.  Once you arrive in Japan, you should be able to redeem the voucher for your pass at a JR office in any major airport or train station.

## Random Tips

* Don’t try to ask for alterations to food dishes (i.e. don’t try ordering a chirashi bowl with salad instead of rice)
* Whenever handing somebody something (eg: credit card for purchases) it’s customary to use two hands and put it in the provided “dish” in front of them and not to hand it directly to the person.
* Much like visiting other countries, don’t bring vegetables or meat with you.  Also, if you are bringing prescription medication (ESPECIALLY Painkillers), bring documentation of the prescription being for you (i.e. the bottle with the prescription and your name on it)
* Mentioned elsewhere but, as a reminder, there are not a lot of garbage cans around Tokyo.  Expect to walk around with anything you have to throw away for a while or until you find a Starbucks.  Or better yet, don’t walk around with anything you might end up needing to throw away.
* No tipping.  It’s considered offensive.
* Whenever you enter a restaurant’s private room, you’ll likely want / need to remove your shoes.  Expect whoever is taking you in to indicate this and be ready to do it.  Custom is for shoes to point towards the door.
* The toilets in Japan have a lot of technology included.  You should be able to understand what most of the buttons are for thanks to the diagrams.
* Some restaurants will have a small black box with a button on the table.  This is used to flag your waiter(ess) and should be used instead of waving your hands.
* While smoking inside is somewhat common, smoking outside is not.  If you’re a smoker, make sure you’re in a spot it’s allowed outside.
* It is possible you’ll walk into a restaurant and ask for a table and be met with a not-friendly look along with crossing of fingers/forearms.  They, generally, aren’t trying to be rude.  They’re afraid of not being able to give you good service because you don’t speak Japanese and they don't speak English.  Try to take it in stride and find somewhere else to eat or go with a Japanese fluent friend or colleague.  
* If you want the bill, you can also hold your index fingers up in an X.
* Museums and temples and parks and shrines are generally free.  Once you learn how to donate at a shrine, it’s not a bad idea and it’s usually just a coin.
* Your ATM card will likely not work at most normal banks or ATMs.  Instead, use ATMs at the airport or at convience stores like 7-11, Family mart, etc.  If you’re staying at the Strings in Shinagawa there is a 7-11 right outside the door.
* One thing you may hear about are [Maid Cafes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_caf%C3%A9).  These are an odd (at least for non-Japanese) phenomenon called a cosplay cafe.  In them, waitresses dress as maids and serve you food and drink and take pictures and do performances.  While not my cup of tea, to each their own.  You’ll find these throughout Tokyo though most likely in Akihabara.
* Animal Cafes are another thing in Tokyo.  This is where you go and sit amongst animals of a certain type and I’ve heard of quite a variety include owl cafes, snake cafes, penguin cafes, and more.  If you're interested I’d highly suggest reading reviews and trying to get a feel for how well a place takes care of the animals.  Generally, reviews indicate things aren't very humane.
* Vending machines are everywhere in Japan and are a quick way to get a coffee, miso soup, water, beeru, and much more.  
* Canned cold coffee is much more prevalent in Japan.  
* The [Shinkansen][Shinkansen] are the famous bullet trains of Japan.  Unfortunately, if you’re just visiting Tokyo, you won’t be taking one of these.  If you’re staying in the Shinagawa area, you’ll almost certainly see them pulling in / leaving from the station.  
* Outside of market areas, walking with food and drink is fairly rare.
* A reminder: you should get some yen before you leave or shortly after arriving.  Your ATM card won’t work at all ATMs but getting a Pasmo / Suica card and filling it requires yen.
* If you’re going shopping, bring your passport with you.  Many stores will sell you things untaxed since you’re taking it back to the states but they need to staple the receipt to a page in your passport.  There will be someone you hand that in to when you leave at the airport.  
* At Japanese sushi restaurants, miso soup is usually enjoyed at the end of the meal, unlike in American places where it’s at the beginning.
* Formally exchanging business cards in Japan is [a thing](https://blog.gaijinpot.com/exchanging-business-cards-japan/).
