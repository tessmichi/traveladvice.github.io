This is meant to be a brief primer on travelling to Japan.  To make it easy, details for major cities ([Tokyo][tokyo], [Kyoto][kyoto], [Osaka][osaka]) have been broken out into separate pages.  This page will contain general Japan information such as what to pack, what airports are in the area, common phrases, etc.


## Packing for Japan

The biggest concern when packing for Japan is arguably clothing.  Many people think of Japan and think of business and that they need to wear formal business clothing to both work and out to eat.  Unless you’re going to Japan with plans to meet customers / paNrtners at their place of work or doing a major presentation, chances are good you do not need to bring dress clothes.  Additionally, chances are good that if you’re going to a restaurant / occasion strict enough to warrant something more than business casual, you either already know more than I do or you have someone in Japan that does.  If you’re going to the Microsoft office, you will absolutely see many people in dress clothes.  This is especially true when you see the rush hour throngs spilling out of Shinagawa Station.  I’ve never worn anything more than business casual and even that has been uncommon on my trips.  I do highly recommend good, comfortable walking shoes.  There is a lot of walking to be done in Japan.

Obviously, bring the sort of stuff you’d take on any other trip to a major city with beautiful scenery, like your camera.  For power adapters, you’ll often find outlets that match the American 3 prong style.  More common though is the two prong style also used in the United States.  For those, they make two prong to three prong adapters if needed.  


## Getting to Japan

You’ll most likely be flying into either Haneda or Narita airports.  Haneda airport is much closer to Tokyo itself and, therefore, is easier to get to.  Most airlines still fly into Narita airport which is further away and I’ll provide more information about below.  As I fly Delta, they fly to Narita from Seattle so the bulk of my knowledge is based off that.  I always request the Japanese meal as it always seems much better than the American offerings are but that’s preference.  If you do fly Delta, they’re currently in the process of requesting slots at Haneda so hopefully in the future you’ll be able to fly to the much closer airport.

## Random Tips

* Don’t try to ask for alterations to food dishes (i.e. don’t try ordering a chirashi bowl with salad instead of rice)
* Whenever handing somebody something (eg: credit card for purchases) it’s customary to use two hands and put it in the provided “dish” in front of them and not to hand it directly to the person.
* Much like visiting other countries, don’t bring vegetables or meat with you.  Also, if you are bringing prescription medication (ESPECIALLY Painkillers), bring documentation of the prescription being for you (i.e. the bottle with the prescription and your name on it)
* Mentioned elsewhere but, as a reminder, there are not a lot of garbage cans around Tokyo.  Expect to walk around with anything you have to throw away for a while or until you find a Starbucks.  Or better yet, don’t walk around with anything you might end up needing to throw away.
* No tipping.  Seriously, don’t try.  It’s offensive.
* Whenever you enter a restaurant’s private room, you’ll likely want / need to remove your shoes.  Expect whoever is taking you in to indicate this and be ready to do it.  Bonus points for pointing shoes towards the door.
* The toilets in Japan are out of a sci-fi movie.  That said, you should be able to understand what all of the buttons are for due to the diagrams.
* Some restaurants will have a small black box with a button on the table.  This is used to flag your waiter(ess) and should be used instead of waving your hands.
* While smoking inside is somewhat common, smoking outside is not.  If you’re a smoker, make sure you’re in a spot it’s allowed outside.
* It is possible you’ll walk into a restaurant and ask for a table and be met with a not-friendly look along with crossing of fingers/forearms.  They, generally, aren’t trying to be rude.  They’re afraid of not being able to give you good service because you don’t speak Japanese.  Try to take it in stride and find somewhere else to eat or go with a Japanese fluent friend or colleague.  
* If you want the bill, you can also hold your index fingers up in an X.
* Museums and temples and parks and shrines are generally free.  Once you learn how to donate at a shrine, it’s not a bad idea and it’s usually just a coin.
* Your ATM card will likely not work at most normal banks or ATMs.  Instead, use ATMs at the airport or at 7-11s.  If you’re staying at the Strings there is a 7-11 right outside the door.
* One thing you may hear about are [Maid Cafes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_caf%C3%A9).  These are an odd (at least for non-Japanese) phenomenon called a cosplay cafe.  In them, waitresses dress as maids and serve you food and drink and take pictures and do performances.  While not my cup of tea, to each their own.  You’ll find these throughout Tokyo though most likely in Akihabara.
* Animal Cafes are another thing in Tokyo.  This is where you go and sit amongst animals of a certain type and I’ve heard of quite a variety include owl cafes, snake cafes, penguin cafes, and more.  While I can’t get behind this, if you’re interested, I’d highly suggest reading reviews and trying to get a feel for how well a place takes care of the animals.
* Vending machines are everywhere in Japan and are a quick way to get a coffee, miso soup, water, beeru, and much more.  
* One additional thing you’ll notice is that canned cold coffee is much more prevalent in Japan.  Especially considering it’s just getting to be a thing in the US.  
* The [Shinkansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen) are the famous bullet trains of Japan.  Unfortunately, if you’re just visiting Tokyo, you won’t be taking one of these (well maybe fortunately, they are very expensive).  However, if you’re staying in the Shinagawa area, you’ll almost certainly see them pulling in / leaving from the station.  
* Outside of market areas, walking with food and drink is fairly rare.
* Just a reminder that you should get some yen ASAP before you leave.  Your ATM card won’t work at all ATMs but getting a Pasmo card / filling it requires yen.
* If you’re going shopping, bring your passport with you.  Many stores will sell you things untaxed since you’re taking it back to the states but they need to staple the receipt to a page in your passport.  There will be someone you hand that in to when you leave at the airport (or so I’m told).  
* At Japanese sushi restaurants, miso soup is usually enjoyed at the end of the meal, unlike in American places where it’s at the beginning.
* Formally exchanging business cards in Japan is [still a thing](https://blog.gaijinpot.com/exchanging-business-cards-japan/).
